  - Consistent styling across components

- ✅ **Navigation**
  - Routing between Dashboard, Chat, and Wizard components
  - Return to Dashboard button in Chat
  - History sidebar in Dashboard

### Mock Data Integration

- ✅ **Mock Assistants Data**

  - Display of mock assistants in Dashboard
  - Selection and navigation to specific assistant chats

- ✅ **Mock Templates Data**

  - Display of mock templates in Dashboard
  - Selection for new case creation

- ✅ **Mock Chat History**
  - Display of mock messages in Chat interface
  - Simulated message sending and receiving

## Current Status

- **Frontend Completion**: ~70%
- **Backend Integration**: ~10%
- **RAG Implementation**: ~5%
- **Overall Project**: ~40%

## Known Issues

1. **Navigation Issues**

   - Some clickable elements may not register clicks properly
   - Navigation between components can sometimes be inconsistent

2. **Dark Mode**

   - Some components may not properly respect dark mode settings
   - Transitions between modes could be smoother

3. **Mock Data Limitations**

   - Current mock data is limited and doesn't fully represent real-world scenarios
   - No persistence of user actions with mock data

4. **Performance Concerns**

   - Large components may cause performance issues
   - No optimization for mobile devices

5. **Accessibility Gaps**
   - Some elements may not be fully accessible
   - Keyboard navigation needs improvement in some areas

## Next Milestones

1. **Backend Connection (Target: Week 3)**

   - Implement Supabase authentication
