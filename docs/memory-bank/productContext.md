# Product Context - Lexpert Case AI

This document explains why Lexpert Case AI exists, the problems it solves, and how it should work from a product perspective.

## Why This Project Exists

Lexpert Case AI was created to address critical challenges faced by family law and trademark attorneys:

1. **Mid-Trial Document Generation**
