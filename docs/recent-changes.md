# Recent Changes - February 27, 2024

This document outlines the recent changes made to the Lexpert Case AI application, specifically focusing on the navigation, UI simplification, terminology updates, and dark mode implementation.

## Changes Made

### 1. UI Simplification and Terminology Updates

We simplified the user interface and updated terminology to be more user-friendly:

- Changed terminology from "bots" to "assistants" throughout the application
- Removed "Bot" from template names (e.g., "Texas Family Code" instead of "Texas Family Code Bot")
- Simplified the Dashboard by removing redundant elements:
  - Removed the duplicate title bars
  - Moved control buttons (dark mode toggle, voice commands, logout) to the top header
  - Removed the redundant "Direct Navigation" section
- Added a prominent "Return to Dashboard" button in the Chat interface
- Added breadcrumb navigation in the Chat interface for better context

**Files Modified:**

- `src/frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`
- `src/frontend/src/pages/Chat.tsx`

### 2. Navigation Improvements

We enhanced the navigation in the Chat component by:

- Adding a prominent "Return to Dashboard" button in the navigation header
- Implementing breadcrumb navigation to show the current location
- Ensuring proper routing between dashboard and chat interfaces
- Adding keyboard shortcuts for faster navigation (Alt+B)
- Fixed issues with clickable elements in the Dashboard by:
  - Replacing Card components with direct HTML elements for better click handling
  - Adding explicit pointer-events-auto styling to ensure clicks are registered
  - Implementing proper event handling with stopPropagation and preventDefault
  - Improving keyboard accessibility with tabIndex and onKeyDown handlers

**Files Modified:**

- `src/frontend/src/components/Chat.tsx`
- `src/frontend/src/App.tsx`
- `src/frontend/src/components/common/Card.tsx`
- `src/frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`

### 3. Dark Mode Implementation

We implemented a robust theme switching mechanism:

- Created a ThemeContext to manage dark mode state across the application
- Added a toggle button with moon/sun icons in the Chat and Dashboard interfaces
- Implemented localStorage persistence for user preferences
- Configured Tailwind CSS for dark mode support with the 'class' strategy
- Added proper CSS classes for dark mode styling in index.css
- Fixed dark mode toggle functionality to properly apply styles to all components
- Added keyboard shortcuts for theme toggling (Alt+M)

**Files Modified:**

- `src/frontend/src/context/ThemeContext.tsx` (new file)
- `src/frontend/src/pages/Chat.tsx`
- `src/frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`
- `src/frontend/src/App.tsx`
- `src/frontend/tailwind.config.cjs`
- `src/frontend/src/index.css`

### 4. Accessibility Enhancements

We improved accessibility by:

- Adding ARIA labels to all interactive elements
- Implementing keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Ensuring proper color contrast in both light and dark modes
- Making the interface screen reader friendly
- Improving keyboard navigation for clickable elements
- Adding role="button" and tabIndex attributes to clickable elements
- Implementing keyboard event handlers for Enter and Space key presses

## Project Structure Clarification

During our work, we identified that the project has a specific structure that should be maintained:

- The main frontend code is located in `src/frontend/`, not in the root `src/` directory
- The frontend should be run from the `src/frontend/` directory using `npm run dev`
- The backend is located in the root `backend/` directory
- **Important**: Always activate the conda environment (`conda activate lexpert_case_ai`) in each new terminal window before running any commands

## Running the Application

To run the application after these changes:

1. Start the frontend:

   ```bash
   # Activate conda environment first
   conda activate lexpert_case_ai

   # Navigate to the frontend directory and start the server
   cd src/frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Start the backend (in a separate terminal):

   ```bash
   # Activate conda environment first (in a new terminal window)
   conda activate lexpert_case_ai

   # Navigate to the backend directory and start the server
   cd backend
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

## Known Issues

- If the page appears blank, ensure you're running the frontend from the correct directory (`src/frontend`)
- If styles are missing, check that Tailwind is properly configured in the frontend directory
- If you encounter "command not found" errors, make sure you've activated the conda environment in your current terminal window

## Troubleshooting Navigation Issues

If you encounter issues with navigation or clickable elements:

1. **Check for CSS conflicts**: Some CSS frameworks can interfere with click events - we've added explicit pointer-events-auto to ensure clicks are registered
2. **Try the Return to Dashboard button**: Located in the header of the Chat interface, this button provides reliable navigation back to the dashboard
3. **Check browser console**: Look for any JavaScript errors that might be preventing clicks
4. **Clear browser cache**: Sometimes cached CSS or JavaScript can cause issues with interactive elements
5. **Try a different browser**: If the issue persists, try using a different browser to identify if it's browser-specific

## Next Steps

Potential future improvements:

1. Refine the mobile responsiveness of the navigation
2. Add animation transitions for theme switching
3. Implement user preferences for additional accessibility options
4. Add more keyboard shortcuts for power users
5. Further improve click handling and event propagation
6. Consider implementing a more robust routing solution if navigation issues persist
