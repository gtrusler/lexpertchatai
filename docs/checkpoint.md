# Project Checkpoint - February 27, 2024

This document provides a snapshot of the current status of the Lexpert Case AI project, tracking our progress, current work, and upcoming tasks.

## Current Status

### Completed Features

1. **Core UI Framework**

   - Basic layout with Dashboard and Chat interfaces
   - Navigation between screens
   - Responsive design for desktop and tablet

2. **Dashboard Interface**

   - Display of assistants (formerly "bots") with case information
   - Template selection for new cases
   - History viewing for past conversations
   - Dark mode toggle

3. **Chat Interface**

   - Message display with user and assistant messages
   - Input area with send functionality
   - File upload capability
   - Voice input toggle
   - Dark mode toggle
   - Return to Dashboard navigation
   - Memory sidebar toggle

4. **Theme System**

   - Dark/light mode toggle with persistent preferences
   - ThemeContext for application-wide state management
   - Tailwind CSS configuration for dark mode
   - Consistent styling across components

5. **Accessibility Features**
   - ARIA labels on interactive elements
   - Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
   - Proper color contrast in both themes
   - Focus management for keyboard navigation

### In Progress

1. **Backend Integration**

   - Currently using mock data for assistants, templates, and messages
   - Need to connect to actual Supabase backend
   - Implement proper authentication flow

2. **File Processing**

   - File upload UI is in place
   - Need to implement actual file processing with auto-tagging
   - Connect to backend storage

3. **RAG Implementation**
   - Basic chat UI is ready
   - Need to connect to actual LLM endpoints
   - Implement retrieval-augmented generation with proper sources

## Technical Debt

1. **Code Organization**

   - Some components are too large and should be refactored
   - Need better separation of concerns in Dashboard and Chat components
   - Consider implementing a more robust state management solution

2. **Testing**

   - No automated tests currently in place
   - Need unit tests for critical components
   - Need integration tests for user flows

3. **Error Handling**
   - Basic error handling in place
   - Need more comprehensive error states and recovery mechanisms
   - Implement proper logging

## What's Next

### Short-term (1-2 weeks)

1. **Backend Connection**

   - Connect to Supabase for authentication
   - Implement actual data fetching for assistants and templates
   - Store and retrieve chat history

2. **File Processing**

   - Implement file upload to Supabase Storage
   - Connect to NLP services for auto-tagging
   - Implement document chunking for RAG

3. **UI Polish**
   - Refine animations and transitions
   - Improve mobile responsiveness
   - Add loading states and skeleton screens

### Medium-term (2-4 weeks)

1. **RAG Implementation**

   - Connect to OpenAI/Anthropic APIs
   - Implement vector search with pgvector
   - Add source attribution and citation

2. **Advanced Features**

   - Implement voice commands
   - Add prompt coaching with real-time suggestions
   - Implement memory management

3. **Testing and Optimization**
   - Add comprehensive test suite
   - Optimize performance for large documents
   - Implement caching for faster responses

### Long-term (1-2 months)

1. **Multi-user Support**

   - Implement team collaboration features
   - Add role-based permissions
   - Enable sharing of assistants between users

2. **Analytics**

   - Track usage metrics
   - Implement token counting and budget management
   - Add performance analytics

3. **Advanced RAG**
   - Implement multi-agent workflows
   - Add cross-domain knowledge integration
   - Implement agentic RAG capabilities

## Current Metrics

- **Frontend Components**: ~25 components implemented
- **Backend Endpoints**: Basic structure in place, needs implementation
- **UI Completion**: ~70% of planned UI components
- **Functionality**: ~40% of planned features
- **Performance**: Target 3-5s response time (not yet measured with real backend)

## Blockers and Risks

1. **Backend Integration**

   - Need to finalize Supabase schema
   - Ensure proper authentication flow

2. **LLM Integration**

   - Need to establish API connections to OpenAI/Anthropic
   - Ensure proper error handling for API limits and failures

3. **Document Processing**
   - Need to implement efficient chunking strategy
   - Ensure proper vector storage and retrieval

## Next Meeting Agenda

1. Review UI improvements and dark mode implementation
2. Discuss backend integration strategy
3. Plan file processing implementation
4. Assign tasks for next sprint
5. Set timeline for RAG implementation
