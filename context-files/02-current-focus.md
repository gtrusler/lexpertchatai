# Lexpert Case AI - Current Focus

## Current Work Focus

The current development focus is on implementing and enhancing the Templates feature, along with ongoing UI improvements and bug fixes. Recent work has focused on fixing template-document connections and improving error handling throughout the application.

## Active Tasks

### Templates Feature Enhancement

- **Template-Document Connections (Updated 3/21/2025)**:
  - Created a `template_documents` junction table with:
    - `template_id`: UUID (references templates.id with CASCADE delete)
    - `document_id`: UUID
    - `created_at`: TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE (default now())
    - Primary key on (template_id, document_id)
  - This enables many-to-many relationships between templates and documents
  - Enhanced frontend components to support document selection for templates
  - Fixed error handling when template_documents table doesn't exist
  - Improved user feedback with detailed error messages
  - Added robust error recovery to preserve template updates even when document connections fail

- **Templates Table Updates**:
  - Added `prompt` field to store generation prompts for templates
  - Added `case_history` field to store case background information
  - Added `participants` field to store information about case participants
  - Added `objective` field to store the template's intended purpose
  - Enhanced form validation and user feedback
  - Implemented search and filtering capabilities
  - Added loading states and error handling

### Document Upload Functionality

- **Fixed Issues (3/18/2025)**:
  - Enhanced storage service with comprehensive error handling
  - Implemented automatic bucket creation and validation
  - Added proper error detection for "bucket already exists" scenarios
  - Improved file upload options with caching and upsert capabilities
  - Added detailed logging for debugging

- **Unified Upload Approach**:
  - Both Chat.tsx and Documents.tsx now use the same storage service
  - Removed the backend API dependency for file uploads in Documents.tsx
  - Simplified the upload process by handling everything client-side
  - Improved error handling and user feedback

### Backend Refactoring

- **Modular Structure Implementation (3/19/2025)**:
  - Created separate modules for routes, services, and models
  - Implemented clean separation of concerns
  - Moved from a single main.py to a structured application
  - Enhanced error handling and response consistency
  - Added proper documentation for each endpoint

### Current Debugging Focus

- **Documents Page Blank Screen Issue**:
  - Checking Supabase connectivity and environment variables
  - Verifying template_documents junction table
  - Monitoring browser console during operations

## Recent Changes

### 1. Extended Templates Table Schema (3/21/2025)
- Added additional fields to templates table:
  - `case_history` field to store case background information
  - `participants` field to store information about case participants
  - `objective` field to store the template's intended purpose
- Updated frontend components to support the new fields:
  - Updated `AddTemplateForm` component with new input fields and state management
  - Updated `EditTemplate` component to display, edit, and save the new fields
  - Enhanced `TemplateList` component to include new fields in search functionality
- Updated context files to reflect schema changes

### 2. Enhanced Templates with Document Connections (3/20/2025)
- Added `prompt` field to templates table
- Created template_documents junction table
- Updated frontend components for document selection
- Enhanced form validation and user feedback

### 3. Fixed Document Upload Functionality (3/18/2025)

- Added proper error detection for bucket operations
- Improved file upload options with caching and upsert capabilities

### 4. Fixed Template Document Connections (3/21/2025)
- Fixed "Unknown error" when updating templates with document connections
- Enhanced error handling in Supabase service for template document operations
- Improved error messages to provide clear feedback about missing tables
- Added table existence checks before performing operations
- Created migration script for template_documents table
- Implemented graceful fallback to preserve template updates even when document connections fail

### 5. Backend Refactoring (3/19/2025)
- Created modular structure with separate modules
- Enhanced error handling and response consistency
- Added proper documentation for each endpoint
- Improved logging throughout the application

## Testing Status

✅ Chat page file uploads working  
✅ Documents page file uploads working  
✅ Proper error handling and feedback  
✅ Bucket creation and management  
✅ Backend server starts successfully  
✅ API endpoints accessible  
✅ Template document connections working  
❌ Documents page blank screen issue (in progress)  

## Project-Specific Commands

- **Test Environment Variables**: Navigate to `/env-test` page
- **Check Document Upload**: Monitor browser console during upload
- **Test Supabase Connection**: Try direct API calls if components fail
- **Debug Options**: Add `?debug=true` to URLs to enable enhanced console logging
