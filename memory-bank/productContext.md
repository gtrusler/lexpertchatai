# Lexpert Case AI - Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

Lexpert Case AI was created to address critical challenges faced by family law and trademark attorneys:

1. **Information Overload**: Attorneys like Cristi in Austin, TX must process vast amounts of case law, statutes, and client documents under tight time constraints.

2. **Mid-Trial Support**: Legal professionals need immediate, accurate information during trials and hearings, with no time for extensive research.

3. **Document Generation**: Drafting legal documents is time-consuming and repetitive, taking valuable time away from client interaction and case strategy.

4. **Cross-Domain Complexity**: Attorneys often handle multiple practice areas (e.g., family law and trademarks) requiring different knowledge bases and document types.

## Problems Solved

### For Family Law Attorneys

- **Rapid Document Generation**: Quickly draft custody motions, temporary orders, and examination questions with proper legal citations.
- **Case Law Retrieval**: Instantly access relevant Texas Family Code sections and precedents during client meetings or court proceedings.
- **Document Analysis**: Efficiently summarize and extract key information from lengthy case files, CPS reports, and court documents.

### For Trademark Attorneys

## How It Should Work

1. **Case Management**: Users create case-specific assistants that maintain context about particular legal matters.
