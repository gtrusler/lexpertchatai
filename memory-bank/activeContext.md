## Current Focus: Debugging Documents Page Blank Screen Issue

We are currently working on resolving an issue where the Documents page (`http://localhost:5173/documents`) is displaying a blank screen. This is a critical component of the Lexpert Case AI application that allows users to upload, view, and manage legal documents.

### Recent Changes

1. **Environment Variable Configuration**

   - Added `.env` file in the frontend directory with Supabase credentials
   - Implemented enhanced logging for environment variables
   - Created an environment test page at `/env-test` to diagnose environment variable issues

2. **Error Handling Improvements**

   - Added comprehensive error logging in Documents and DocumentList components
   - Implemented better loading states with visual feedback
   - Added fallback mechanisms for Supabase initialization failures
   - Improved authentication flow with better error handling

3. **Debugging Tools**
   - Created debug HTML files to test API connectivity
   - Added detailed console logging with DEBUG flags
   - Implemented environment variable testing utilities

### Current Issues

1. **Blank Page Persistence**

   - Despite improvements, the Documents page still shows a blank screen
   - Environment variables appear to be properly configured in the `.env` file
   - Debug logs have been added but may not be visible due to the blank page

2. **Potential Root Causes**

   - Supabase client initialization may be failing silently
   - React component might be encountering a fatal error during rendering
   - Authentication flow could be causing an infinite redirect loop
   - Environment variables might not be properly loaded by Vite

3. **Next Debugging Steps**
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Verify if the React root is properly mounting
   - Test authentication flow independently
   - Confirm Supabase connectivity with direct API calls

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Authentication Strategy**

   - Using Supabase Auth for user authentication
   - Admin role check implemented in Documents component
   - Redirect to login page if user is not authenticated

2. **Error Handling Approach**

   - Comprehensive error states with user-friendly messages
   - Detailed console logging for debugging
   - Fallback UI for various error scenarios

3. **Environment Variable Management**
   - Using Vite's import.meta.env for accessing environment variables
   - Added .env file in frontend directory to ensure variables are accessible
   - Implemented logging and fallbacks for missing variables

## Current Development Focus

The immediate focus is on resolving the blank page issue with the Documents component. This involves:

1. Diagnosing the root cause through browser console inspection and debug tools
2. Implementing a fix that addresses the underlying issue
3. Adding more robust error handling to prevent similar issues
4. Ensuring proper loading of environment variables in the Vite application

Once this issue is resolved, we can continue with the planned development of document management features, including:

- Auto-tagging of uploaded documents
- Integration with the RAG pipeline for document analysis
- Implementing document search functionality
