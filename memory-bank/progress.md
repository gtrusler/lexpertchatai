# Project Progress

## Template Enhancements and Document Connections (3/20/2025) - COMPLETED âœ…
âœ… **Template Feature Enhancements**
- Added `prompt` field to templates table for storing generation prompts
- Created `template_documents` junction table for many-to-many relationships
- Updated frontend components to support the new fields and relationships
- Added UI for selecting documents as knowledge sources for templates
- Enhanced DocumentList to show which templates each document is connected to
- Updated database schema documentation in techContext.md
- Created migration scripts for database schema changes

### Implementation Details
- Added template-document connections:
  - Junction table with template_id and document_id
  - RLS policies for proper access control
  - UI for selecting and managing document connections
- Enhanced template form with prompt field for AI generation guidance
- Updated Supabase service with new methods for managing template-document connections

## Templates Table Implementation (3/19/2025) - COMPLETED âœ…
âœ… **Templates Functionality Implemented**
- Created `templates` table in Supabase public schema
- Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) policies for proper access control
- Added auto-updating timestamp trigger for `updated_at` field
- Fixed "relation 'public.templates' does not exist" error
- Inserted sample template for testing
- Verified templates page functionality

### Implementation Details
- Table Structure:
  - `id`: UUID primary key with auto-generation
  - `name`: TEXT (unique, not null)
  - `description`: TEXT
  - `content`: TEXT
  - `created_at` and `updated_at`: Timestamps
- RLS Policies:
  - Anyone can read templates
  - Authenticated users can create, update, and delete templates
- Created migration scripts:
  - `templates_migration.sql`: Original migration script
  - `simplified_templates_migration.sql`: Improved version with proper RLS syntax
  - `basic_templates_table.sql`: Minimal version for quick setup

## Backend Refactoring (3/19/2025) - COMPLETED âœ…
âœ… **Modular Architecture Implemented**
- Refactored from monolithic to modular structure
- Separated concerns into routes, services, and models
- Improved error handling and logging
- Fixed linting issues throughout the codebase

## Document Upload Status (3/18/2025) - RESOLVED âœ…
~~ðŸš¨ **Upload Failures**~~
- ~~Successful bucket creation (200 OK responses)~~
- ~~Silent failure after bucket creation~~
- ~~No UI error feedback~~
- ~~Bucket persistence issues~~

âœ… **All Issues Resolved**
- Enhanced storage service with comprehensive error handling
- Implemented automatic bucket creation and validation
- Added proper error detection for bucket operations
- Improved file upload options with caching and upsert capabilities
- Unified upload approach across Chat and Documents pages

## Verified Working
âœ… Backend API endpoint handling
âœ… Frontend-backend connectivity
âœ… Auto-reload functionality
âœ… Multiple concurrent requests
âœ… Direct Supabase storage uploads
âœ… Bucket creation and management
âœ… Error handling and feedback

## Implementation Details
- Enhanced storage service in `src/frontend/src/services/supabase.ts`
- Removed dependency on backend API for file uploads
- Added proper error type handling
- Implemented bucket existence checks
- Added detailed logging for debugging

## Console Evidence
```plaintext
[Supabase Storage] Checking if bucket 'documents' exists
[Supabase Storage] Bucket 'documents' exists
[Supabase Storage] Uploading file to documents/general/1710819647_test.pdf
[Supabase Storage] Upload successful
```

## Completed Steps

### Backend Refactoring (3/19/2025)
1. âœ… Refactored main.py to a clean entry point
2. âœ… Created modular structure with routes, services, and models
3. âœ… Implemented proper logging and error handling
4. âœ… Fixed linting issues (f-strings, line length, indentation)
5. âœ… Verified backend functionality with all refactored code

### Document Upload (3/18/2025)
1. âœ… Enhanced storage service with better error handling
2. âœ… Implemented direct Supabase storage uploads
3. âœ… Added proper bucket existence checks
4. âœ… Improved error messages and user feedback
5. âœ… Unified upload approach across components
