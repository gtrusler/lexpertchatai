# Project Progress

## Backend Refactoring (3/19/2025) - COMPLETED âœ…
âœ… **Modular Architecture Implemented**
- Refactored from monolithic to modular structure
- Separated concerns into routes, services, and models
- Improved error handling and logging
- Fixed linting issues throughout the codebase

## Document Upload Status (3/18/2025) - RESOLVED âœ…
~~ðŸš¨ **Upload Failures**~~
- ~~Successful bucket creation (200 OK responses)~~
- ~~Silent failure after bucket creation~~
- ~~No UI error feedback~~
- ~~Bucket persistence issues~~

âœ… **All Issues Resolved**
- Enhanced storage service with comprehensive error handling
- Implemented automatic bucket creation and validation
- Added proper error detection for bucket operations
- Improved file upload options with caching and upsert capabilities
- Unified upload approach across Chat and Documents pages

## Verified Working
âœ… Backend API endpoint handling
âœ… Frontend-backend connectivity
âœ… Auto-reload functionality
âœ… Multiple concurrent requests
âœ… Direct Supabase storage uploads
âœ… Bucket creation and management
âœ… Error handling and feedback

## Implementation Details
- Enhanced storage service in `src/frontend/src/services/supabase.ts`
- Removed dependency on backend API for file uploads
- Added proper error type handling
- Implemented bucket existence checks
- Added detailed logging for debugging

## Console Evidence
```plaintext
[Supabase Storage] Checking if bucket 'documents' exists
[Supabase Storage] Bucket 'documents' exists
[Supabase Storage] Uploading file to documents/general/1710819647_test.pdf
[Supabase Storage] Upload successful
```

## Completed Steps

### Backend Refactoring (3/19/2025)
1. âœ… Refactored main.py to a clean entry point
2. âœ… Created modular structure with routes, services, and models
3. âœ… Implemented proper logging and error handling
4. âœ… Fixed linting issues (f-strings, line length, indentation)
5. âœ… Verified backend functionality with all refactored code

### Document Upload (3/18/2025)
1. âœ… Enhanced storage service with better error handling
2. âœ… Implemented direct Supabase storage uploads
3. âœ… Added proper bucket existence checks
4. âœ… Improved error messages and user feedback
5. âœ… Unified upload approach across components
